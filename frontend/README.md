This project is a generative AI based advisor designed to help Clemson Computer Science students register for classes.
The program collects user data through a website created with flask and provides the user with a suggested class plan for
their next semester.  Using an aws API call to a custom knowledge base that we created, the LLM outputs a concise class 
schedule based on numerous requirements such as courses already completed, prerequisites, and amount of credit hours.
